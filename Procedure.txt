1. Get all individual tournament scoring data
    - This is done by running:
        python tourneyScoringScraper.py

    - To get scoring data for all completed tournaments
        - Use --years flag
            - EX: --years 2021 2022 2023 2024
        - Don't use current year as an input here

    - To get the field and odds for the upcoming tournament
        - Use --years *current_year*
            - EX: --years 2025
        - Also need to use flag --tourneycompleted
            - When this flag is set the script will only extract the field of players playing and their odds to win
        - Putting the two arguments together:
            - EX: python tourneyScoringScraper.py --years 2025 --tourney-completed
